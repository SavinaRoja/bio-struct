Version 1.5

Now only one optimization scheme can be applied
in one run, i.e. BioCore is not produced simultaniously 
with the best geometric core.
To select the optimization scheme use parameter:
	#0 - pure geometry
	#1 - PAM250 scoring  
	#2 - BioCore according to classification of parameter BioCore below
	Scoring 0

For this reason only *_set.res and *_sol.res are created (almost in all cases
only *_sol.res are relevant for the user).


BioCore parameters are changed:
	#calculate bio-core according to the following classification
	# 0- user defined. Reads file 'biocore.in'
	# 1- identity
	# 2- Hydrophobic - A,V,I,L,M,C 
	#    Hydrophilic +charged - K,R,H 
	#    Hydrophilic -charged - D,E   
	#    Hydrophilic polar uncharged - S,T,P,N,Q 
	#    Aromatic - F,Y,W 
	#    Glycine - G 
	# 3- (default)
	#    Hydrophobic - A,V,I,L,M,C 
	#    Hydrophilic +charged, -charged, polar - K,R,H,D,E,S,T,P,N,Q
	#    Aromatic - F,Y,W 
	#    Glycine - G 
	BioCore 3

Now you can use user defined amino acid classification. Example of
'biocore.in' is provided with the installation.
